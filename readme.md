# About

This folder contains projects related to web design fundamentals. HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, GitHub and Responsive Design are briefly covered. These are project examples that invoke the usage of these things, or have some relevance to these areas. 

Note: This is a repository for some of my coding-related assignments, and does not contain exhaustive subject matter-related information. The likely most useful components of this directory are the `02-css3`, `03-jquery`, and `04-github` folders. The `css3` directory contains examples of image to HTML/CSS conversion. The `jQuery` folder contains some good examples of utilizing various jQuery functions for everything from DOM manipulation to handling front-end validations. The `github` folder contains some useful lists of github commands or common syntax needs.
