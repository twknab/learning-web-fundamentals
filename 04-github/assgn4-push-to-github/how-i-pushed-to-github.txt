1. First thing I did was goto github.com and create a new repo with name 'basic_repo'
2. Second thing I did was open terminal and create a new directory called 'basic_repo' and entered that directory.
3. Next, in the local directory, I created index.html and style.css
4. I added these files to the local repo staging area, and committed them.
5. Once committed, added the remote origin repo, and pushed to it.
6. I then opened index.html and style.css and added some elements and attributes.
7. I then added these files to the local staging area, and committed.
8. Once committed locally, I then pushed to origin master, which added these new changes to my remote repository.

All the newly pushed data now appears at:
