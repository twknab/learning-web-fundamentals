Design a simple registration form with validation. Make sure your page doesn't allow the form to submit in any case. If the required information is there when the form is submitted, an alert box will pop up with the valid information being displayed. If the name is not included, have an error message appear. Feel free to add more fields and create validations for them. Typically, your form validations are handled by your back-end language, but this is an excellent introduction as to how to design things of this nature!
