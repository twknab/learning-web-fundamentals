/* What is Bootstrap?
In the words of its creators, bootstrap is a "sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development."


To use Bootstrap, first put the following lines in the <head> section of your file:

<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
Now you can go ahead and  add Bootstrap classes to your HTML elements in order to easily achieve consistent, clean, and responsive design.

For your assignment:
