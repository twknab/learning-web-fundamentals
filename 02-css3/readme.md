# About

The assignment folders contained within this directory are all mockup image to HTML/CSS creations. That is, we take an image and turn it into a replica via HTML5 and CSS3. Sometimes this is called 'pixel-perfect' design, ie, taking a photoshop image and generating valid code from an image. Feel free to explore these project files or peek inside of the `Lesson Files` directory for some additional CSS3 resources.
